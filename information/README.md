# FIM Application
* [benchmark.py](/information/benchmark.py) - Benchmarks parameter uncertainty calculations using MCMC sampling, nested sampling and the FIM approach.
* [bilayer.py](/information/bilayer.py) - To do
* [confidence_ellipses.py](/information/confidence_ellipses.py) - Plots the FIM confidence ellipses on MCMC and nested sampling corner plots.
* [time_dependence.py](/information/time_dependence.py) - Explores how fitting and FIM errors change with increasing time.
* [utils.py](/information/time_dependence.py) - Contains code for FIM calculation and sampling using MCMC or nested sampling.
* [variances.py](/information/variances.py) - Compares the inverse FIM with the variance in parameter estimation obtained over many fits.
