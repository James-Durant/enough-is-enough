### Simulation
* [measured_data.py](/simulation/measured_data.py) - Fits [measured data](/simulation/data) to obtain a ground truth model and uses this model to compare the data to its simulated counterpart.
* [simulate.py](/simulation/simulate.py) - Contains the code for simulating single and multiple contrast experiments. Uses a [directbeam](/simulation/data/directbeam_wavelength.dat) file of incident neutron flux as a function of wavelength.
* [structures.py](/simulation/structures.py) - Defines a number of structures of varying complexity used for FIM applications.
* [utils.py](/simulation/utils.py) - Contains various utility functions for plotting SLD profiles and reflectivity curves.
