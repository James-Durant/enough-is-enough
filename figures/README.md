Figure 1: Measured reflectivity (top) and simulated reflectivity (bottom) vs. momentum transfer, for each measurement angle of the measured sample.

Figure 2: The FIM confidence ellipses for k=1,2,3 (red) overlaid on the corner plots of MCMC (black) and nested sampling (blue) for the mostly uncorrelated parameter sample (left) and correlated parameter sample (right). Inset are the SLD profiles (top) and rebinned simulated reflectivity curves (bottom) of the two samples.

Figure 3: Log parameter fitting errors (top) and log FIM errors (bottom) vs. log time for each parameter of the mostly uncorrelated parameter sample (left) and correlated parameter sample (right); the errors are taken as the mean from 10 simulated experiments for a given measurement time. Included in the legends are an approximation of the gradients of the lines, m, as given by linear regression.

Figure 4: Fitted experimental reflectivity vs. momentum transfer (top) for the Si/D2O interface and the two solution isotopic contrast datasets, H2O and D2O, offset for clarity by factors of 10^-2 and 10^-3 respectively. Inset are the corresponding fitted SLD profiles. Also shown (bottom) is the FIM for each for each layer thickness and roughness vs. increasing contrast SLD from H2O to D2O.
